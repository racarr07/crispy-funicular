<h2>What This Website Is</h2>
<p>Hello my name is Rachel, and am a woman from Louisville, Kentucky, in my late 20's. This website is going to be a fun project for me to share my thoughts, hobbies, and 
	feelings, and to explore and develop my web programming skills.</p>

	<h1>December 12, 2020</h1>
	<p>I've been starting to see album(s) of the year posts on the Instagram vinyl accounts I follow, so I thought it would be a good time to give my thoughts on this topic.
		My album of the years is <strong>Spanish Love Songs</strong> <strong><i>Brave Faces Everyone<strong></i>. This album came out in the beginning of the year. At the time,
		I didn't think much of it even though I did preorder it. I listened to the album over the summer. I had put it off listening to it until I listened to 
		<i>Kick</i> on Spotify. After that, I kept reminding myself to listen to it and kicking myself for not listening to it when it came out. As soon as I finished
		listening to it I knew it was going to be my album of the year (even with contender <i>Lament</i> coming out late in the year). To me the album has
		summed up the year pretty well-a feeling of hopelessness and desperation brought about due to COVID which amplified normal struggles like depression, 
		lonliness, and debt. I felt it was a higer energy version of The Menzingers <i> Good Things </i>. My favorite tracks of this album are <i>Losers</i>
		and <i>Beach Front Property</i>.</p>

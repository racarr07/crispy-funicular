<h1>What This Website Is</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Rachel, and am a woman from Louisville, Kentucky, in my late 20's. This website is going to be a fun project for me to share my thoughts, hobbies, and 
	feelings, and to explore and develop my web programming skills.</p>

	<p>I've been starting to see album(s) of the year posts on the Instagram vinyl accounts I follow, so I thought it would be a good time to give my thoughts on this topic.
		My album of the years is <strong>Spanish Love Songs</strong> <strong><i>Brave Faces Everyone</strong></i>. This album came out in the beginning of the year. At the time,
		I didn't think much of it even though I did preorder it. I listened to the album over the summer. I had put it off listening to it until I listened to 
		<i>Kick</i> on Spotify. After that, I kept reminding myself to listen to it and kicking myself for not listening to it when it came out. As soon as I finished
		listening to it I knew it was going to be my album of the year (even with contender <i>Lament</i> coming out late in the year). To me the album has
		summed up the year pretty well-a feeling of hopelessness and desperation brought about due to COVID which amplified normal struggles like depression, 
		lonliness, and debt. I felt it was a higer energy version of The Menzingers <i> Good Things </i>. My favorite tracks of this album are <i>Losers</i>
		and <i>Beach Front Property</i>.</p>

	<h2>December 13, 2020</h2>
	<p>In the news this past week, it has been revealed that the US Government is suing Facebook in order to break up a monopoly that was acquired in 2012. In 2012,
		they acquired Instagram and WhatsApp. The US Government has claimed this was an unlawful monopoly. It's gotten me thinnking about Sony which has recently
		gotten Funimation and just required AT&T's VRV and Crunchyroll in a multi-billion dollar deal. Sony is under scrutiny by some anime fans because in the US
		Funimation and Crunchyroll are the two big players, and it's not good for competition and consumers if there aren't many choices in the market. Consumers 
		ultimately fear for price increases and lower product quality. Funimation and Crunchyroll/AT&T both have customers that are critical of their products
		due to issues and what they feel reluctance to fix these issues. Funimation customers that have these complaints fear that the products will become even
		more lackluster due to what they have already seen from Sony. In the time since Sony has acquired Funimation the only change that has occured is an expansion
		of the Funimation library. There has been no change in the web or mobile app as far as appearance or improvements. As a Funimation customer, I prefer
		the VRV app. I have complaints about the VRV app, I'm unable to use the IOs mobile app because it always gives an error message when I go to any series. It
		has given me little problems with the desktop, tablet, Roku, and console apps. It would be very convient if Sony decided to combine Crunchyroll's and 
		Funimation's library on VRV.</p>
			<p>Crunchyroll fans fear that this merger may reduce quality of English dubs because they prefer the Bang Zoom dubs to the Texas-based Funimation
		English dubbed voice actors, but they ultimately are hoping for improvement in Crunchyroll's app and series acquisitions. I'm very interested to
		see how this will all turn out but now I believe Sony is going to have the companies operate how they currently are. I'm also interested to see
		if Sony will try to acquire Sentai (which if they do I'm absolutely positive they will get in trouble with the US Government). With Sony's current
		acquisitions I'm also curious if the US Government is watching and if there could be trouble in the future like what Facebook is currently dealing with.</p>

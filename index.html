<h1>What This Website Is</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Rachel, and am a woman from Louisville, Kentucky, in my late 20's. This website is going to be a fun project for me to share my thoughts, hobbies, and 
	feelings, and to explore and develop my web programming skills.</p>

	<p>I've been starting to see album(s) of the year posts on the Instagram vinyl accounts I follow, so I thought it would be a good time to give my thoughts on this topic.
		My album of the years is <strong>Spanish Love Songs</strong> <strong><i>Brave Faces Everyone</strong></i>. This album came out in the beginning of the year. At the time,
		I didn't think much of it even though I did preorder it. I listened to the album over the summer. I had put it off listening to it until I listened to 
		<i>Kick</i> on Spotify. After that, I kept reminding myself to listen to it and kicking myself for not listening to it when it came out. As soon as I finished
		listening to it I knew it was going to be my album of the year (even with contender <i>Lament</i> coming out late in the year). To me the album has
		summed up the year pretty well-a feeling of hopelessness and desperation brought about due to COVID which amplified normal struggles like depression, 
		lonliness, and debt. I felt it was a higer energy version of The Menzingers <i> Good Things </i>. My favorite tracks of this album are <i>Losers</i>
		and <i>Beach Front Property</i>.</p>

	<h2>December 13, 2020</h2>
	<p>In the news this past week, it has been revealed that the US Government is suing Facebook in order to break up a monopoly that was acquired in 2012. In 2012,
		they acquired Instagram and WhatsApp. The US Government has claimed this was an unlawful monopoly. It's gotten me thinnking about Sony which has recently
		gotten Funimation and just required AT&T's VRV and Crunchyroll in a multi-billion dollar deal. Sony is under scrutiny by some anime fans because in the US
		Funimation and Crunchyroll are the two big players, and it's not good for competition and consumers if there aren't many choices in the market. Consumers 
		ultimately fear for price increases and lower product quality. Funimation and Crunchyroll/AT&T both have customers that are critical of their products
		due to issues and what they feel reluctance to fix these issues. Funimation customers that have these complaints fear that the products will become even
		more lackluster due to what they have already seen from Sony. In the time since Sony has acquired Funimation the only change that has occured is an expansion
		of the Funimation library. There has been no change in the web or mobile app as far as appearance or improvements. As a Funimation customer, I prefer
		the VRV app. I have complaints about the VRV app, I'm unable to use the IOs mobile app because it always gives an error message when I go to any series. It
		has given me little problems with the desktop, tablet, Roku, and console apps. It would be very convient if Sony decided to combine Crunchyroll's and 
		Funimation's library on VRV.</p>
			<p>Crunchyroll fans fear that this merger may reduce quality of English dubs because they prefer the Bang Zoom dubs to the Texas-based Funimation
		English dubbed voice actors, but they ultimately are hoping for improvement in Crunchyroll's app and series acquisitions. I'm very interested to
		see how this will all turn out but now I believe Sony is going to have the companies operate how they currently are. I'm also interested to see
		if Sony will try to acquire Sentai (which if they do I'm absolutely positive they will get in trouble with the US Government). With Sony's current
		acquisitions I'm also curious if the US Government is watching and if there could be trouble in the future like what Facebook is currently dealing with.</p>

	<h2>December 23, 2020</h2>
	<p>This past few years, I've been digging deep and expanding my musical horizons. In 2017, I was very into emo and indie rock, in 2018 I was rediscovering and branching
		out into the punk rock I was into in 2003-2004 (Fat Wreck and Epitaph type bands), in 2019 I was listening to a lot of ska, punk, and hardcore. This year
		has been very much like 2019, but with folk rock/punk and indie rock. I really connected to lyrics by Nana Grizol, Pat the Bunny, The Wonder Years, 
		Spanish Love Songs, and Phoebe Bridgers. As stated in my previous post, I related a lot to <i> Brave Faces Everyone </i> with it's discussion of depression,
		desperation, and hopelessness. I really liked the lyrics of <strong> Beach Front Property </strong> <i> If every city is the same doom and gloom under
		a different name, maybe we should find our home in one. </i> I also like the lyrics of <strong> Routine Pain </strong> <i> Have you ever felt lower than 
		everyone else? I'm feeling lower than anyone else. 'Cause everything's lower than everything else. I wanna see how much lower I can go. </i> </p>
	<p> Lastly, I really connected with Phoebe Bridgers <strong> Funeral </strong>. I've been listening to a lot of podcasts this past month, and I recently listened
		to an interview about the background of this song. Bridger's states this song was about her performing at a former classmates funeral who died of an
		heroin overdose. She was saying how she was having a depressive episode during all of this, and she felt like an awful person for being sad about
		her life when someone's kid was dead. It makes me think she was thinking about perspective-the world's bigger than you and your depression seems
		selfish, silly, and meaningless in comparison. True, I've thought these things myself but it's not like it changes your mindset. Anyways I really liked <i>
		Jesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time. And that's just how I feel. Always have and I always will. I always have and always will. </i> These lyrics 
		describe the depression experience for myself and others. They're powerful. These next two verses are also really good. <i> I have a friend I call
		when I've bored myself to tears. And we talk until we think we might just kill ourselves, but then we laugh until it disappears. And last night, 
		I blacked out in my car. And I woke up in my childhood bed. Wishing I was someone else, feeling sorry for myself. When I remembered someone's kid is dead.</i>
		Also worth noting, the Spanish Love Songs cover of this songs is really great as well, and I'm hoping Bridgers has heard it too.</p>

	<h2>December 31, 2020</h2>
		<p>As many are, I'm hoping 2021 is a better year. I'm hoping I form some new relationships-romantic and platonic, keep growing as a person, expand
		my skills, learn about a lot of things, hear some great new albums, and achieve some short term goals. I learned some valuabe things this year, 
		but faced a lot of hardship. I've spent a lot of time reflecting on the past and thinking about the many who I've lost
		these past fourteen years. With this year and all the bad things that occurred prior, I'm hoping it all leads me to a better state of mind
		and helps me grow. I'm generally tired and hoping that I get some clarity this coming year.</p>

	<h2>January 24, 2020</h2>
	<p>It's been a bit! A lot of things have been going on since I last posted. I started the spring semester and am taking 4 classes-SQL, Python, CIT Careers, and Data
	Driven Web Pages. Along with that I've been working full-time as usual. There has been a lot of overtime and when I have free time I need to do things like
	chores and shower, so when I'm not doing any of that I just feel bleh from the exhaustion. With that said, I've been thinking of what to write on my next
	post. As I mentioned on one of my previous posts I listen to a lot of podcasts. At work I'm on a computer all day and having a podcast in the background helps
	me work. So I've listened to a ton of interesting stuff.</p>
		<p>I listened to a a few different podcast episodes about MK-ULTRA. I have always been extremely interested in this phenomenon since I was 12/13 years old
		when I watched a documentary called <i>The Drug Years</i> that discussed the psychedelic drug LSD and how it was used by the CIA in experiments. Through these
		podcasts and my own research I discovered the alarmingness of the experiments. The scope and methods itself were terryifying. The program went on from
		the late 1940's to the early 1970's. LSD was used to test prisoners of war in Germany and Japan (the descriptions sound like torture), American prisoners
		were tested on (some with promises of a shorten sentence which unsurprisngly didn't happen), Military personnel were knowingly tested, and men who solicited
		sex workers were dosed with LSD unknowingly. The two most controversial things that came from MK-ULTRA was the mysterious death of CIA scientist Frank Olsen
		who fell from a window in the early 1960's (upon review it appears to be a murder and not an "accidental fall" or suicide), Olsen was laced with LSD
		and freaked out. Prior he was upset about learning the scope of the MK-ULTRA experiments and told someone he was going to quit and reveal the project. The
		second controversial thing revealed was that in Montreal, QC acclaimed psychiatrist Dr. Ewen Cameron was hired by the CIA and the Canadian Government
		to use LSD and torture methods on unknowing patients. There were documents and testimonies that described Cameron giving patients who had things like
		depression and nerve damage numerous doses of LSD and other drugs, using high doses of electroshock therapy, using psychic driving (depriving someone of 
		their senses and playing messages over and over again), using psychic driving and putting someone in a box for a month, and putting them in comas.
		All the methods Cameron used had the intention of making them be broken individuals who were brought back to an infant like state where they couldn't function. 
		With Cameron's experiments the goal was to see if reprogramming people was possible and all the other MK-ULTRA experiments mentioned were to see if brainwashing
		and secrets could be revealed with LSD. All of this happened with no oversight under a man named Sidney Gottlieb and with the logic that anything goes in the 
		name of national security.</p>

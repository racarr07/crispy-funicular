<h1>What This Website Is</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Rachel, and am a woman from Louisville, Kentucky, in my late 20's. This website is going to be a fun project for me to share my thoughts, hobbies, and 
	feelings, and to explore and develop my web programming skills.</p>

	<p>I've been starting to see album(s) of the year posts on the Instagram vinyl accounts I follow, so I thought it would be a good time to give my thoughts on this topic.
		My album of the years is <strong>Spanish Love Songs</strong> <strong><i>Brave Faces Everyone</strong></i>. This album came out in the beginning of the year. At the time,
		I didn't think much of it even though I did preorder it. I listened to the album over the summer. I had put it off listening to it until I listened to 
		<i>Kick</i> on Spotify. After that, I kept reminding myself to listen to it and kicking myself for not listening to it when it came out. As soon as I finished
		listening to it I knew it was going to be my album of the year (even with contender <i>Lament</i> coming out late in the year). To me the album has
		summed up the year pretty well-a feeling of hopelessness and desperation brought about due to COVID which amplified normal struggles like depression, 
		lonliness, and debt. I felt it was a higer energy version of The Menzingers <i> Good Things </i>. My favorite tracks of this album are <i>Losers</i>
		and <i>Beach Front Property</i>.</p>

	<h2>December 13, 2020</h2>
	<p>In the news this past week, it has been revealed that the US Government is suing Facebook in order to break up a monopoly that was acquired in 2012. In 2012,
		they acquired Instagram and WhatsApp. The US Government has claimed this was an unlawful monopoly. It's gotten me thinnking about Sony which has recently
		gotten Funimation and just required AT&T's VRV and Crunchyroll in a multi-billion dollar deal. Sony is under scrutiny by some anime fans because in the US
		Funimation and Crunchyroll are the two big players, and it's not good for competition and consumers if there aren't many choices in the market. Consumers 
		ultimately fear for price increases and lower product quality. Funimation and Crunchyroll/AT&T both have customers that are critical of their products
		due to issues and what they feel reluctance to fix these issues. Funimation customers that have these complaints fear that the products will become even
		more lackluster due to what they have already seen from Sony. In the time since Sony has acquired Funimation the only change that has occured is an expansion
		of the Funimation library. There has been no change in the web or mobile app as far as appearance or improvements. As a Funimation customer, I prefer
		the VRV app. I have complaints about the VRV app, I'm unable to use the IOs mobile app because it always gives an error message when I go to any series. It
		has given me little problems with the desktop, tablet, Roku, and console apps. It would be very convient if Sony decided to combine Crunchyroll's and 
		Funimation's library on VRV.</p>
			<p>Crunchyroll fans fear that this merger may reduce quality of English dubs because they prefer the Bang Zoom dubs to the Texas-based Funimation
		English dubbed voice actors, but they ultimately are hoping for improvement in Crunchyroll's app and series acquisitions. I'm very interested to
		see how this will all turn out but now I believe Sony is going to have the companies operate how they currently are. I'm also interested to see
		if Sony will try to acquire Sentai (which if they do I'm absolutely positive they will get in trouble with the US Government). With Sony's current
		acquisitions I'm also curious if the US Government is watching and if there could be trouble in the future like what Facebook is currently dealing with.</p>

	<h2>December 23, 2020</h2>
	<p>This past few years, I've been digging deep and expanding my musical horizons. In 2017, I was very into emo and indie rock, in 2018 I was rediscovering and branching
		out into the punk rock I was into in 2003-2004 (Fat Wreck and Epitaph type bands), in 2019 I was listening to a lot of ska, punk, and hardcore. This year
		has been very much like 2019, but with folk rock/punk and indie rock. I really connected to lyrics by Nana Grizol, Pat the Bunny, The Wonder Years, 
		Spanish Love Songs, and Phoebe Bridgers. As stated in my previous post, I related a lot to <i> Brave Faces Everyone </i> with it's discussion of depression,
		desperation, and hopelessness. I really liked the lyrics of <strong> Beach Front Property </strong> <i> If every city is the same doom and gloom under
		a different name, maybe we should find our home in one. </i> I also like the lyrics of <strong> Routine Pain </strong> <i> Have you ever felt lower than 
		everyone else? I'm feeling lower than anyone else. 'Cause everything's lower than everything else. I wanna see how much lower I can go. </i> </p>
	<p> Lastly, I really connected with Phoebe Bridgers <strong> Funeral </strong>. I've been listening to a lot of podcasts this past month, and I recently listened
		to an interview about the background of this song. Bridger's states this song was about her performing at a former classmates funeral who died of an
		heroin overdose. She was saying how she was having a depressive episode during all of this, and she felt like an awful person for being sad about
		her life when someone's kid was dead. It makes me think she was thinking about perspective-the world's bigger than you and your depression seems
		selfish, silly, and meaningless in comparison. True, I've thought these things myself but it's not like it changes your mindset. Anyways I really liked <i>
		Jesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time. And that's just how I feel. Always have and I always will. I always have and always will. </i> These lyrics 
		describe the depression experience for myself and others. They're powerful. These next two verses are also really good. <i> I have a friend I call
		when I've bored myself to tears. And we talk until we think we might just kill ourselves, but then we laugh until it disappears. And last night, 
		I blacked out in my car. And I woke up in my childhood bed. Wishing I was someone else, feeling sorry for myself. When I remembered someone's kid is dead.</i>
		Also worth noting, the Spanish Love Songs cover of this songs is really great as well, and I'm hoping Bridgers has heard it too.</p>

	<h2>December 31, 2020</h2>
		<p>As many are, I'm hoping 2021 is a better year. I'm hoping I form some new relationships-romantic and platonic, keep growing as a person, expand
		my skills, learn about a lot of things, hear some great new albums, and achieve some short term goals. I learned some valuabe things this year, 
		but faced a lot of hardship. I've spent a lot of time reflecting on the past and thinking about the many who I've lost
		these past fourteen years. With this year and all the bad things that occurred prior, I'm hoping it all leads me to a better state of mind
		and helps me grow. I'm generally tired and hoping that I get some clarity this coming year.</p>

	<h2>January 24, 2021</h2>
	<p>It's been a bit! A lot of things have been going on since I last posted. I started the spring semester and am taking 4 classes-SQL, Python, CIT Careers, and Data
	Driven Web Pages. Along with that I've been working full-time as usual. There has been a lot of overtime and when I have free time I need to do things like
	chores and shower, so when I'm not doing any of that I just feel bleh from the exhaustion. With that said, I've been thinking of what to write on my next
	post. As I mentioned on one of my previous posts I listen to a lot of podcasts. At work I'm on a computer all day and having a podcast in the background helps
	me work. So I've listened to a ton of interesting stuff.</p>
		<p>I listened to a a few different podcast episodes about MK-ULTRA. I have always been extremely interested in this phenomenon since I was 12/13 years old
		when I watched a documentary called <i>The Drug Years</i> that discussed the psychedelic drug LSD and how it was used by the CIA in experiments. Through these
		podcasts and my own research I discovered the alarmingness of the experiments. The scope and methods itself were terryifying. The program went on from
		the late 1940's to the early 1970's. LSD was used to test prisoners of war in Germany and Japan (the descriptions sound like torture), American prisoners
		were tested on (some with promises of a shorten sentence which unsurprisngly didn't happen), Military personnel were knowingly tested, and men who solicited
		sex workers were dosed with LSD unknowingly. The two most controversial things that came from MK-ULTRA was the mysterious death of CIA scientist Frank Olsen
		who fell from a window in the early 1960's (upon review it appears to be a murder and not an "accidental fall" or suicide), Olsen was laced with LSD
		and freaked out. Prior he was upset about learning the scope of the MK-ULTRA experiments and told someone he was going to quit and reveal the project. The
		second controversial thing revealed was that in Montreal, QC acclaimed psychiatrist Dr. Ewen Cameron was hired by the CIA and the Canadian Government
		to use LSD and torture methods on unknowing patients. There were documents and testimonies that described Cameron giving patients who had things like
		depression and nerve damage numerous doses of LSD and other drugs, using high doses of electroshock therapy, using psychic driving (depriving someone of 
		their senses and playing messages over and over again), using psychic driving and putting someone in a box for a month, and putting them in comas.
		All the methods Cameron used had the intention of making them be broken individuals who were brought back to an infant like state where they couldn't function. 
		With Cameron's experiments the goal was to see if reprogramming people was possible and all the other MK-ULTRA experiments mentioned were to see if brainwashing
		and secrets could be revealed with LSD. All of this happened with no oversight under a man named Sidney Gottlieb and with the logic that anything goes in the 
		name of national security.</p>

	<h2>April 30, 2021</h2>
	<p>It's been a very long time. I have been very busy with my courses and work. I'm finishing up some end of the semester work, but I had some stuff on my mind. I
		started a new job in November, and have done a poor job keeping in touch with my former colleagues. In that time, 2 people who I used to work with have
		passed away. They were both older men, but it's still crazy to me. It makes me think of things like mortality and the reality of people being fine one day
		and dead the next. These were men that I used to see almost every day regularly and now they're both dead. One of them retired within the past couple of
		years, while the other died while recovering on leave from cancer treatment. RIP Mr. B and Glenn.</p>

	<h2>May 9, 2021</h2>
	<p>For the past few years I've been rediscovering my love of anime and have watched more these few years than I ever have. I really like historical fiction
		or science fiction that ties into actual history. I like Yona of the Dawn which is a historical fiction based in ancient Korea. It's about a high
		mantienence naive princess who's father is assasisinated by her childhood love. The assassin becomes King and Princess Yona travels the country
		with companions discovering herself, the kingdom outside of the palace, and how to take back the throne. The next one I like is called Kingdom which
		is based on the Waring States period of China. Peasants Xin and Piao dream of becoming great generals of the Qin Kingdom. Events lead to Xin and Piao 
		being seperated, and Xin meeting the Prince of Qin-Zheng. Zheng and Xin work together in their pursuits-to united the Middle Kingdoms under Zheng, and Xin
		to become the Kingdom's greatest general. The next is Viland Saga which is based on something that has really fascinated me prior to reading the manga.
		Vinland is what historians now believe to be the Viking colony discovered in Newfoundland, and they also believe the Vikings to be the first Europeans
		to make to the American continent. In the series, Thorfinn a young boy from Iceland is seeking for revenge on a man named Askeladd for murdering his
		father Thors. In the beginning, Thorfinn is told stories by Leiff Erickson about his travels to Vinland which he describes as a vast green place
		where you are free. Later, Thorfinn seeks Vinland. The last two series I will discuss are Mobile Suit Gundam 0079 and Legends of the Galactic Heroes.</p>
	<p>MSG 0079 is based in a universe where due to pollution and nuclear war Earthlings move to other colonies in the solar system. Together they are known as the
		Earth Federation. One of these colonies called Zeon which rebels and declares independence from the Federation. The story starts in the middle of war between
		Zeon and the Federation. Thus far, Zeon has had the advantage with weaponry and warfare. The Zeons have developed machinery/weaponry called mobile suits
		that a person pilots. Their ace is a young mysterious man named Char Aznable. It's worth noting that Zeon seems to be based on European aristocracy and
		monarchy, and the Earth Federation is supposed to be an idealized world (not really the case though) as far as gender and race. Overall, both sides have
		faults and it's hard to say good vs bad and right vs wrong. MSG 0079's creator and writers were witnesses of World War Two and were
		children during this time in Japan. Much of the stories are parallels to events in WW2 and current events taking place during the 1970's. The writers
		did a fantastic job with these parallels. I highly recommend listening to the podcast Mobile Suit Breakdown which does in depth analysis of the episodes
		and discusses the historical references.</p>
	<p>Lastly, Legend of the Galactic Heroes is a dense and very complex narrative. There are two sides fighting an unending war-the Free Planets Alliance and the Empire.
	Much like Gundam neither side seems to be good. The Alliance was created by Empire citizens who fleed what they saw as tyranny and created the Alliance. The
		Empire seems Old World European and has monarchy and nobility. The Alliance has a President and what seems to be a small Parliament. The President
		has a secret military organization who kill people who criticize him or the government. Historically, the series pulls from a lot of sources-mainly
		Chinese and Japanese, but I see parallels to Austro-Hungarian Empire, Russian Empire, the US, and Romans. Moreover, I think it's interesting the 
		Empire seems very German and Austrian influenced and talk about Odin and Valhalla, and the Alliance has Black and Asians in their top military roles (and
		the Empire is very Old European as stated previously).</p>

	<h2>May 30, 2021</h2>
	<p>I decided to make today's post about Memorial Day. From my own research into my family tree and from stories from my father I found out information about my
		father's side of the family's involvement in the American military. My mother has been dead for almost 15 years and I know very little about her family's 
		involvement in the American military besides her father being in the National Guard before getting married and starting a family. My great grandfather Tony 
		Carr was a World War I veteran who did duty in France. I remember seeing pictures of him during that time, I believe he did something involving artillery. 
		Through my father's mother, there is a man named Jacob F. Hauser who was from Switzerland and immigrated to Tell City, IN. He served in the Union Army
		during the Civil War. The only picture I saw of him was his him posing in his Union uniform. Also, John Carr an immigrant from Ulster, Ireland and settler
		of Maryland and Pennsylvania fought in the Revolutionary War. My father also told me that my grandfather's youngest brother (Anthony was his name),
		was a Vietnam War veteran who suffered heavily from PTSD and drank himself death.</p>
	<p>I don't know how any of these men felt about war (and assume most were drafted-who's to say about John Carr), but their service is appreciated.</p>

	<h2>June 19, 2021</h2>
	<p>Today I've decided to write about music I've been listening to lately. For the past decade, I've been going through phases with my music for example I remember
		8-9 years ago being really into 80's and 90's alt/indie rock and 90's punk (The Replacements, Hole, Superchunk, MTX for example) and then moving into 
		pop-punk/emo for exclusively for like 3 years. At the moment I've been listening to a lot of 70's and early 80's punk-Johnny Thunders & the Heartbreakers, 
		The Dictators, Husker Du, The Wipers, Weirdos, Buzzcocks, Naked Raygun, The Clash, and Dead Boys as well as recent indie rock-Mitski, Phoebe Bridgers, Angel Olsen, Waxahatchee, and Japanese Breakfast.
		Then I'll get some urges for some punk/hardcore(Starter Jackets, Circle Jerks, Jawbreaker, Raging Nathans, Jeff Rosenstock, Mikey Erg, Rancid, Green Day, and
		Black Flag).</p> 
			I've been really diging the 70's and 80's sound it's very distinct. The Dictators, Dead Boys, and Johnny Thunders have a very regional sound that
	I can only describe as uniquely New York. Unrelated but I noticed that Dead Boys "High Tension Wire" sounds like X "Nausea." I wonder if X was influenced by the Dead
	Boys. Obviosuly, Ray Manzarek of the Doors provided keys to X on their albums but I was thinking about it but both of their bands sound like they were influenced
	by The Doors. Moreover, I've been thinking that the Dead Boys and Johnny Thunders both must have been influenced by "Raw Power" because I could hear it in their music.
	I could hear it especially in the Dead Boys "Aint it Fun." Another thought about the Dead Boys-the bootleg "Third Generation Nation" LP sounds excellent compared to
	"We Have Come For Your Children." I guess it's because they signed to a major label and the record producer was told to make the record mainstream and markatable.
	It sounds awkward and forced, the pre-mix of the bootleg is definitely better and I'm wondering if they used those mixes on the "Sonic Reducer" Greatest Hits LP.</p>
<p>In The Wipers and Husker Du, I can hear the influence of the New York bands and The Stooges as well as contemporaries like Mission of Burma and The Replacements. Mission
	Of Burma was greatly influenced by British New Wave of the late 70's with emphasis on Wire's "Pink Flag." In The Wipers sound, intentionally or unintentionally I can
	hear something like Wire and Gang of Four in their sound. I know the Replacements were influenced by 60's and 70's rock, Johnny Thunders, and Buzzcocks and knew
	they were tight with Husker Du and was wondering how much their sound influenced them. Lastly, "Target" a song off "Everything Falls Apart" reminded me a lot of early 
	Black Flag and through browsing old hardcore flyers I saw that they used to play tons of shows together, so I'm guessing they were probably influenced by them as well.</p>
</p>Lastly, I'm going to talk about my thoughts on the modern indie rock I've been listening to. I would first like to notice how all of these artists have made records recently
that have been artistic. "Be the Cowboy", "All Mirrors", "Saint Cloud", "Soft Sounds from Another Planet", and "Punisher". All these albums were well received and I was thinking
about how much these artists (if it all) were influenced by each other's artistic choices and sounds overall. I appreciate the artistry as someone who is a fan of albums: "Clarity",
"Dear You", "Pinkerton", "Let It Be(1984)", "Pet Sounds", "Rubber Soul". I mention "Let It Be" is found among them because it is a phenomenol alternative/indie rock album 
that people like for Paul Westerberg's nakedness and sincerity song-writing. I can see all women (Olsen, Mitski, Zauner, Crutchfield, Bridgers)
appreciating Westerberg's song-writing especially Bridgers. I love Michelle Zauner and Angel Olsen unapologetically memtioning their love of 1960's girl group and Phil Spector-esque
sounds on their music. "Boyish" especially makes me think of Phil Spector and Zauner mentioned "Be My Baby" for the intro drum. I like how Olsen, Miski, and Zauner didn't
stick to a particular sound and all three albums feature "big" sounding songs in the vein of "Table for Glasses", "Lucky Denver Mint", and "Goodbye Sky Harbor". In "All Mirrors",
you start with "Lark" that starts slow and bends to a crescendo like "A Day in the Life" and "Table for Glasses" when it reaches the climax, then you get moments like "What It Is"
which features strings and is reminiscent to big 70's rock like Queen or even Zeppelin "Kashmir", and finally something like "New Love Cassette" which is like "Hey Baby" but
more artistry. "Be the Cowboy" has "Nobody" which has an upbeat sounding piano with sad lyrics, "Remember My Name" which is electropop sounding, and "Me and My Husband" which
makes me think of clowns and mimes because of her lyrics. I will admit that I have yet to listen completely to "Soft Sounds", "Saint Cloud", and "Punisher." But even so, I get
the narratives. Zauner like Olsen and Mitski made an artistic experimental pop record with deeply personal lyrics and uses sounds she's never used before. Crutchfield also
uses deeply personal lyrics and takes her sound in a familiar yet different approach. She goes back to her roots of country with her familiar indie and folk. Even though
I've not suffered from recovery from addiction I still empathize with the lyrics of "War." Bridgers like Crutchfield and Zauner, took her familiar sound and deep, sad, and honest
lyrics and added layers-like using the trumpet in "Kyoto" and a crescedno a la "A Day in the Life" in "The End Is Near".</p>
